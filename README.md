# Rock Climbing City Analysis

My experience living in San Carlos de Bariloche for two months has made me appreciate locations where climbing day trips are possible. As part of my own exploration of where I would like to live, I was curious to find a way to determine how many good quality climbs are within day-trip distance to each city.

For this project I definied good quality climbs as:
1. Between rating 5.9 and 5.11a
1. 3 or more stars on Mountain Project sorted by most popular first. 

As Mountain Project only allows 1000 results per search to be downloaded, I append the top most popular 1000 climbs for each state to the .csv data file

## count_distance_calculate.ipynb

The `count_distance_calculate.ipynb` notebook is the main code file in this repository. It is responsible for calculating the distances between different rock climbing routes.
