# Rock Climbing City Analysis

My experience living in San Carlos de Bariloche for two months has made me appreciate locations where climbing day trips are possible. As part of my own exploration of where I would like to live, I was curious to find a way to determine how many good quality climbs are within day-trip distance to each city.

For this project I definied good quality climbs as:
1. Between rating 5.9 and 5.11a
1. 3 or more stars on Mountain Project sorted by most popular first.

Bariloche has 116 good quality routes nearby so I'm looking for cities that at least match that.
The furthest I traveled for a day climbing trip from Bariloche was Valle Encantado which was 30 miles as the bird flies so I set that as the distance that qualifies as day-trippable

As Mountain Project only allows 1000 results per search to be downloaded, I append the top most popular 1000 climbs for each state to the .csv data file
